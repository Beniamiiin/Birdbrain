# Birdbrain
A neural network framework written in Swift. The feedforward neural network is loosely based on the 
neural net as implemented in [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)

This isn't really for any immediate use in an iOS or OSX application, simply to practice developing and experimenting with neural nets. If you find any bugs or simply want to contribute, feel free to join in!
