# Birdbrain
A neural network framework written in Swift. The feedforward neural network is loosely based on the 
neural net as implemented in [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)

This isn't really for any immediate use in an iOS or OSX application at the moment, simply to practice developing and experimenting with neural nets in Swift, and using the Accelerate framework and the MEtal API for computing and GPGPU functions. If you find any bugs or simply want to contribute, feel free to join in!
